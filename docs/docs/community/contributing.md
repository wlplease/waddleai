# Contributor Guide

Welcome to the Eliza contributor guide! This document is designed to help you understand how you can be part of building the future of autonomous AI agents, regardless of your technical background.

## The OODA Loop: A Framework for Contribution

We believe in the power of the OODA Loop - a decision-making framework that emphasizes speed and adaptability. OODA stands for:

- **Observe**: Gather information and insights about the project, the community, and the broader AI ecosystem.
- **Orient**: Analyze your observations to identify opportunities for contribution and improvement.
- **Decide**: Choose a course of action based on your analysis. This could be proposing a new feature, fixing a bug, or creating content.
- **Act**: Execute your decision and share your work with the community.

By internalizing the OODA Loop, you can quickly identify areas where you can make a meaningful impact and drive the project forward.

### Tips for Efficient Contribution

- Use tools like OBS and Whisper to record and transcribe your work sessions. This allows you to easily document your process and share insights with the community.
- Leverage AI assistants to help with tasks like code generation, document summarization, and content creation.
- Collaborate with other community members to divide and conquer larger initiatives.

## Recognition and Rewards

We believe in recognizing and rewarding contributors who go above and beyond to drive the project forward. Stand-out contributions may be eligible for:

- Grants from the ai16z Creator Fund
- Featuring your project across various channels
- Opportunities to shape the direction of the project

Note: we're still finalizing details on the creator/dev fund that seeks to retroactively reward valued contributions to the ecosystem.
